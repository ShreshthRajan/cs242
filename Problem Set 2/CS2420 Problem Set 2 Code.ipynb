    "\n",
    "* This problem set must be completed in a team of 3-4 students.  **If you do not have a three or four person group, please email the TFs immediately.**\n",
    "* **We suggest you start right away.** While you will only need to write around **30 lines or fewer of code** per code cell, we expect this assignment to take **3-7 days** of significant effort for a group of three to four (training the networks takes a long time, so don't start at the last second).\n",
    "* The assignment consists of two files: **this Google Colab file** (an `.ipynb` file) and a **LaTeX answer template** (available on Canvas).\n",
    "* The Google Colab contains all assignment instructions and *Code Cells* that you will use to implement the programming components of the assignment (in Python).\n",
    "* We provide a significant amount of the code to make it easier to get started. In the *Code Cells*, please add comments to explain the purpose of each line of code in your implementation. **You will not receive credit for implementations that are not well documented.**\n",
    "* All output from the Colab Notebook **must** be saved. Do not delete code, comment it out if needed. TFs must be able to reproduce your results. **You will not receive credit for implementations that are not reproducible.**\n",
    "* <font color='red'>**Deliverables are highlighted in red**</font> in this Google Colab file. Use the LaTeX answer template to write down answers for these deliverables.\n",
    "* Each group will **submit** a PDF of your answers, any logs from generative AI, and your Google Colab file (.ipynb file) containing all completed *Code cells* to \"Problem Set 2\" on Canvas. Only one submission per group. Check your .ipynb file using this [tool](https://htmtopdf.herokuapp.com/ipynbviewer/) before submitting to ensure that you completed all *Code Cells* (including detailed comments).\n",

    "Outline of this assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Getting Started** [20 points]: In this section, you will train a convolutional neural network in PyTorch on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset. This section will introduce you to the PyTorch machine learning library and training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Post-training Quantization** [60 points]: In this section, you will perform post-training quantization of weights on a small fully-connected neural network trained on the MNIST classification dataset. This section reinforces your understanding of quantization and will give you a concrete understanding of the limitations of quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conv Pruning** [60 points]:  In this section, you will implement a simplified version of structured filter pruning based on [Pruning Filters for Efficient ConvNets](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=rJqFGTslg) and non-structured pruning based on [Learning both Weights and Connections for Efficient Neural Networks\n",
    "](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02626).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Parameter Efficient Fine-tuning** [35 points]: In this section, you will fine-tune a ResNet-18 model using three methods for updating the model: 1) updating all of the models parameters 2) freezing earlier layers and updating the later layers 3) a combinations of frozen layers and low rank updates based on [LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.09685.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Transformer Architecture** [35 points]: In this section, you will be implementing the individual components of the transformer model based on the paper [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). This section will provide further intuition on the attention mechanism and provide you a high-level overview of how data flows through the transformer model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Depthwise Separable Convolution** [40 points]: In this section, you will implement depthwise separable convolutions and train a depthwise convolutional neural network on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset. This section will reinforce your understanding of depthwise convolution operations and improve your PyTorch skills."

To solve this, we want to map the values of the vector such that each value is *approximately* representable by values between 0 and 255. To do this we:\n",

Instead of pruning weights, this paper describes removing whole filters from each convolutional layer in a CNN. Compared to pruning weights across the network, filter pruning is a naturally structured pruning method that does not introduce irregular sparsity. Therefore, it does not require using sparse libraries or specialized hardware.\n",
    "For each convolutional layer, we measure each filterâ€™s relative importance by its absolute weight sum $\\sum|\\mathcal{F}_{i,j}|$ (i.e., its $\\ell_1$-norm). When pruning a layer, $m$ filters with the smallest relative importance will be pruned, where $m$ = (prune percentage $\\times$ total number of filters in this layer).\n",

    "In *Code Cell 3.1*, we provide a `SparseConv2d` layer, which is similar to the standard `nn.Conv2d` layer, but adds a `mask` tensor. The `mask` is used to zero out filters in this layer before the convolution operation is performed. Initially, `mask` is set to all ones, meaning the `SparseConv2d` layer's behavior will be identical to the `nn.Conv2d` layer.\n",
